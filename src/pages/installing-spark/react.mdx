# Installing Spark in a React Project

This guide will walk you through installing and using Spark on an existing
React site. For help with setting up the necessary development environment,
see the [React App Getting Started Guide](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).

By the end of this, you’ll have all the Spark React components available
in your site.

## Installing Sass
<a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a> is a tool that processes and compiles CSS. You’ll need to use Sass
to import Spark styles into your site.

1. Run this command to install Sass:
```
npm install node-sass --save-dev
```
2. Rename `App.css` to `App.scss`
3. In `App.js`, update the import line to point at the new filename.
``` javascript
import './App.scss'
```
4. Create a new file in `src` called `styles.scss` and copy this CSS into it:
``` css
body {
  border: 50px solid pink;
}
```
5. In `App.scss`, import this new file:
``` javascript
@import ‘./styles.scss’;
```

If your React server has stopped, restart it now and view your compiled
React site. You should see the new CSS you’ve written included in the
site, along with the original React CSS:


<div class="sprk-u-Measure">
  <img
    class="sprk-u-mbm"
    style="margin: auto; display: block;"
    src={reactApp}
    alt="Screenshot of Create React App running in a browser."/>
</div>

## Install Spark Packages
Now we’ll use Sass to import all the Spark CSS.

6. Download the required packages with this command. It contains all
of the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS needed to run Spark React components.
```
npm install @sparkdesignsystem/spark @sparkdesignsystem/spark-react --save-dev
```
7. Import the Spark Sass file into the main Sass file (e.g., `App.scss`).
``` javascript
@import '../node_modules/@sparkdesignsystem/spark/spark.scss';
```
When you build and run your website, all the Spark CSS will now be bundled
into your output. You can verify this by inspecting your site’s DOM and
looking for the Spark CSS. There should be a `<style>` tag in the `<head>`
of your page that includes Spark’s styles.
<div class="sprk-u-Measure">
  <img
    class="sprk-u-mbm"
    style="margin: auto; display: block;"
    src={styleCheck}
    alt="Screenshot of DOM with Spark Styles"/>
</div>
If Spark React is installed correctly, you should see these CSS rules
listed in your page’s code.

## Adding React Components
Let’s add a component that will allow us to test that both Spark’s styles
and functionality are working. We’ll use
the [Loading Button](https://react.sparkdesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-button--loading)
component to do this. You can find code for all Spark components
at [react.sparkdesignsystem.com](https://react.sparkdesignsystem.com/).

8. Add a reference to the `SprkButton` component at the top
of `App.js`.

``` javascript
import { SprkButton } from '@sparkdesignsystem/spark-react';
```

9. Copy the sample code into the `return` block in `App.js`.
``` javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <SprkButton loading>Submit</SprkButton>
  );
}
```
You should now see a Spark Button!


<div class="sprk-u-Measure">
  <img
    class="sprk-u-mbm"
    style="margin: auto; display: block;"
    src={spinnergif}
    alt="Screenshot of React App with Spark Spark Button"/>
</div>

## You did it!
You now have a development environment set up with Spark
installed and you’re ready to start  building!
